#Die Skype Die

Ever wanted to close Skype?

Then you know the pain of having to minimise to tray, the right click and the select "actually close this time..."

This sort of behaviour really rubs me the wrong way and there is not setting to change it.

**DieSkypeDie** adds a tombstone to the centre of the Skype title bar which now allows Skype to be closed with one click.
